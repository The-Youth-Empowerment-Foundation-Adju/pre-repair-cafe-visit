# pre-repair-cafe-visit
Visitation of the space by the technical personnel with the aim of registering and identifying faults of the electronic devices within the refugee community awaiting a repair date
# Aims/Objectives.
- To register the required number of devices before repair date.
- To idenfy faults and know the number of devices that might require spares ,the organization can afford.
- To reduce on the number of devices during a repair date,coz earlier registered devices are marked and no more registration will be offered on the repair date
- It gives chance for the organisation to estimate the number of experts on the repair date,
  Thus reducing cost.
- To save time time during repair date
